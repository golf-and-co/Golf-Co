The Els Club is one of the best courses in the UAE with top quality facilities, designed by world golf Hall of Fame member, Ernie Els. It is situated along the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road in Dubai, founded in 2008. It has four tees and is considered to be an good golfing experience, which includes facilities such as a unique restaurant, a fanciful clubhouse and the best golf academy in the region, i.e. the Butch Harmon Golf School. With all of this is also the extra luxury of a personal golf butler to help you in carrying your golf bag and other equipments so that you wouldn’t have to stress yourself carrying anything.

The Golf Course has great elevation changes and undulations for an extremely interesting and tasking golfing experience. The Golf Course isn’t seasonal and top quality golf can be played and enjoyed all round the year. There are areas of sandy waste and of natural vegetation, including grass, to give the very best experience to those who like to challenge themselves.

The Clubhouse can be said to give the perfect experience, with it featuring two world class restaurants, steam rooms, jacuzzis and saunas. Also, there are separate male and female locker rooms, facilities for conferences and events and a lounge for members.

The Els Club’s Pro Shop is known worldwide for its excellence and was named as one of the top 100 stores in 2014 and is the only one on the list that isn’t in North America.

There are two restaurants in the Els Golf Club, the first being the Big Easy Bar and Grill, which has mostly South African cuisine with great food, excellent beverages and amazing company. The second, named the 261 restaurant, got its name from Ernie’s record breaking PGA Tour in 2003.
