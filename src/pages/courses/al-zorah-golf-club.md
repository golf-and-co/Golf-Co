The Al Zorah Golf Club is one of the few naturally exciting and healthy golf courses in all of the UAE. Established in 2015, it is situated in Ajman, about 25 minutes away from the International Airport of Dubai. The Al Zorah Golf Clubâ€™s Golf Course is the very first golf course in Ajman and was a design of Nicklaus Design. Al Zorah Golf Club has a 72 par golf course, two world class restaurants to meet all of your dining needs, a non-comparable wellness centre, one of the very best golf academies and marinas.

The Golf Course is an 18-hole layout for championship that has an in-land area of mangrove. There is also a driving range that is above 350 meters and can take up to 50 golfers at a time. The golf course also features 88 bunkers and two lakes.

The Golf Academy at the Al Zorah Golf Club is specifically designed to meet the golfing needs of every student, no matter their skill, experience or age. The trainers there are top notch PGA professionals and the practice facilities are free to use.

The Al Zorah Golf Club has two very uniquely different restaurants to serve golfers and provide the needed spot for relaxation after a game. There is the Shakespeare and Co, which gives a homelike experience with its warm hospitality, old-fashioned theme and delicious food; not to mention its charming environment. There is also the Thanani which means 'pairing' in Arabic. The restaurant is inspired by modern kitchens in European cities of London, Paris, Barcelona and Rome.
