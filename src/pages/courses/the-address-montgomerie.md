The Address Montgomerie Dubai is a standout amongst the most exhilarating golf courses you will experience in Dubai and across the UAE, opened in 2002. Situated inside the Emirate's richest residential area, from the guests to the driving range, the academy and the par 3 course; all have an entirely different clubhouse to themselves.

The major clubhouse itself is grand, lodging 21 boutique inn rooms, a world class restaurant, a wonderful spa and a majestic outdoor swimming pool. This extravagance stretches out on to the golf course; the golf course is equipped with a very much delegated refreshment cabin on every nine.

The Monty, as it is popularly known, is a very fascinating course that one can play on. Though encompassing a grand total of 14 lakes and 81 bunkers, the landing areas are largely generous and it's a decent test for golfers of every level. The 18-hole and 72-par course for championship at the Monty is one of the UAE’s very best.

The Academy Troon Golf is the golf practice facility of the Address Montgomerie and is one of the best in Dubai. There is a world class swing studio, a tasking 9-hole par 3 Academy Course, an area for short game, an area for practice putting and a practice course. What makes the Academy so special is that you can practice both indoors and outdoors and at all times of the day.

The Monty’s restaurant is a wonderful place to cool off by the eighteenth hole. The very best local and international cuisines are all available at the Monty’s restaurant popularly named after famed golf legend and the designer of the course, Colin Montgomerie.

A Spa can be the place to find peace and restore the balance between your mind and body. This can be achieved at the Address Montgomerie Spa with the various signature treatments available.
