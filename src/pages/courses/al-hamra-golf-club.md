The Al Hamra Golf Club is said to be the very first eighteen-hole course in the UAE. It is located in Ras Khaimah in the shores of the Gulf. The Al Hamra is an eighteen-hole course that was made by designer Peter Harradine; it bends round four water lagoons that are connected and eventually joins with the Arabian Gulf water. It is a par 72 golf course that measures about 7325 yards.

It has a 9-hole par 3 academy golf course with holes that range from 60 to 110 yards and also features a lake of salt water made specifically to test the nerve of the golfer. Not only that, the practice area has pitching areas, putting greens, bunkers and chipping areas. Included within this same practice area are flood lights which are also included in the championship course’s nine holes to ensure that golfers enjoy night golfing on the academy course, driving range and championship course.

The Al Hamra Golf Club has a Golf Shop with all of the latest shoes, clothing, accessories and also golfing equipments. The Golf Shop is located in the clubhouse building. There is a professional team on standby in the shop to give you all of their expertise to ensure you are satisfied with what you leave the shop with.

The Al Hamra Golf Club dining experience is one that won’t be forgotten quickly with two different restaurants available to meet your needs. The Pesto Ristorante is a world class restaurant with international cuisines and a variety of traditional Italian dishes. The Bay Sports Bar is the place to meet and socialize after a game of golf, with the menu consisting of club sandwiches and alike, accompanied by different arrays of cocktails and beers.
