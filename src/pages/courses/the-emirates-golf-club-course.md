It is located in Dubai, the largest and most populated city of the UAE, first opened in 1996 but a new course was opened in 2006. It is a par 72 course and is just a little bit over 7,052 yards and is said to be one of the very finest courses in all of Dubai. It is home to the Dubai Desert Classic, a European PGA tour golfing event. The clubhouse at the Emirates Golf Club is built in a tent-style. One thing that sets the Faldo Course of the Emirates Golf Club from other golf courses is the tough experience of playing on the same course as professionals.

There are actually two courses at the Emirates Golf Club, the new one popularly known as the Faldo because it was built under the supervision of Nick Faldo is a 9 hole, par 72 golf course that is renowned for its night golf.
