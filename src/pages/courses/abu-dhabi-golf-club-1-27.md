The Abu Dhabi Golf Club is the most luxurious and prestigious golf resort in the UAE. The Abu Dhabi Golf Club is located about 10 minutes from the International Airport in Abu Dhabi and a little below 15 minutes from the centre of the city. It has a twenty seven hole championship course, that is home to the European PGA Tour, and provides a balanced mix of challenges with a lush course and well placed bunkers.

The Abu Dhabi Golf Club also has a magnificent clubhouse that has the shape of a falcon bird with wings spread out just overlooking the golf-course. There are other top-notch golfing facilities apart from the clubhouse that has three floors of world-class restaurants, a well equipped meeting room for executives and a club for sports and fitness.

When it comes to dining, the Abu Dhabi Golf Club might just be the best you will come across in the UAE. Caf√© 28 is an all day international dining restaurant located on just the ground floor of the clubhouse and is best for a meal of leisure. There is the option for indoor seating or outdoor seating.

Another restaurant in the Abu Dhabi Golf Club is the Grille Restaurant, a steakhouse with location on the first-floor of the clubhouse. Also, there is the Championship Bar which is basically the best lounge in Abu Dhabi. Last is the pool bar which offers a wide range of refreshing juices, light snacks and cocktails.
