The Golf Course at the Al Ain Equestrian, Shooting and Golf Club first opened in 2007 (then named the Palm Sports Resort), originally as a 9 hole layout inside the Horse Race Track. Since then, under the guidance of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Member of the Executive Council, Chairman of the AESGC and with constant monitoring of progress by the clubâ€™s General Manager, H.E. Mohammed Rashid Al Nasseri the AESGC has flourished into a complete golfing facility.

It has been a busy 2016 at the AESGC as the golf course has been undergoing some major reconstruction, but with the redesigned and modernized front 9 set to reopen, it is clear that there will be exciting times ahead for 2018 and beyond.
