title: Corporate Golf Days
paragraph1: >-
  Who says you can't mix business and pleasure? Corporate Golf Days are the
  perfect way to distinguish your company from the competition, engage with
  existing clients, build relationships with potential clients, and thank
  clients for their valued custom. At Golf & Co. we practice what we preach,
  which is why our Corporate Golf Days are in a class of their own.
paragraph2: >-
  Well-organised Corporate Golf Days create the opportunity for a 10-hour sales
  call. Compare this to the average 20-minute appointment with a harried client
  and it becomes clear that a golf day can do wonders for your client
  relationships. Corporate Golf Days are also extremely effective at luring
  senior executives away from their heavy workloads and other commitments.
  Additionally, Corporate Golf Days provide the smart golf day organiser with
  the chance to pair two attendees up with each other for their mutual benefit.
  In short, Corporate Golf Days create cost-effective networking opportunities,
  build brand loyalty and create goodwill among both customers and staff.
