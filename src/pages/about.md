  ## A little about ourselves


  We are a group of passionate golfers.


  We know exactly what we want when we play golf. We do not put up with
  mediocrity, and we know you don’t either.


  That is the raison d'être of Golf & Co—to provide golf vacations that become a
  holiday to remember.


  When we go on tour ourselves, we have a few principles we follow. First, it
  must represent good value. Second, we insist on the highest quality in
  everything. And third, and most important, the tour must be FUN.


  Some ways we try to make your experience with us unrepeatable with anyone
  else:


  * \    We include courses that other operators do not even consider.

  * \    We use hotels that meet our, not to mention your, high standards. 

  * \    Our contact list in the industry is incomparable… we make the
  impossible possible


  We constantly challenge ourselves to break out from the merely ordinary and
  put on something that sets our pulses - and yours - racing.


  We also work with corporate and private groups. Depending on size, we can also
  tailor your tour to your specific requirements, adding partner programs for
  non-golfers, desert safaris, day trips and other activities. We have every
  angle covered.


  Keep us in mind the next time you’re planning a golf outing!
